# Phase 1: Repository Initialization

- Initialize Git (if not already done)
- Create .gitignore for Node.js (node_modules, .env, dist, etc.)
- Create README.md with setup instructions and project overview
- Initial commit with current working state
- Create GitHub repository and push main branch

## Phase 2: Branching Strategy

- Protected main branch - production-ready code only
- Develop branch - integration branch for features
- Feature branches - feature/description format
- Bugfix branches - bugfix/description format
- Hotfix branches - hotfix/critical-issue format

## Phase 3: PR Workflow & Templates

- Branch protection rules - require PR reviews for main
- PR template with checklist (testing, documentation, etc.)
- Issue templates for bugs and feature requests
- Basic CI checks (build/lint validation)

## Phase 4: Documentation & Scripts

- CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
- Package.json scripts for common tasks (dev, build, test, lint)
- Environment setup instructions (.env.example)
- Deployment guide for production setup

## Immediate Benefits

- Version control for all changes
- Collaborative development with PR reviews
- Issue tracking for bugs and features
- Professional workflow for team scaling
