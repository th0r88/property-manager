# Reports Page Bug Fix Plan

## Phase 1: Form Styling & Alignment (`ReportGenerator.jsx`)

**Objective:** Fix "Select Period" form layout and input consistency

- Add consistent width to all form controls (`w-full`)
- Align form elements properly within grid layout
- Remove increment controls from Year field
- Ensure dropdowns and inputs have matching widths

## Phase 2: Year Field Conversion (`ReportGenerator.jsx`)

**Objective:** Convert Year input to dropdown with 2025-2050 range

- Replace number input with select dropdown
- Generate years 2025-2050 as options
- Set current year as default selection
- Remove increment control styling

## Phase 3: Advanced Filtering System (`ReportGenerator.jsx`)

**Objective:** Add comprehensive filtering for Report Summary

- Add state management for 3 filters: month, year, tenant
- Create filter controls above Report Summary table
- Implement month dropdown (current month as default)
- Implement year dropdown (current year as default) 
- Implement tenant dropdown with "All Tenants" option
- Add "Clear Filters" functionality

## Phase 4: Enhanced No-Data State Handling (`ReportGenerator.jsx`)

**Objective:** Improve no-data messages for filtered results

- Distinguish between "no data at all" vs "no data for filters"
- Add specific messaging for different filter combinations
- Provide helpful hints for adjusting filters
- Handle loading states during filter changes

## Phase 5: Tenant Data Integration (`ReportGenerator.jsx`)

**Objective:** Connect tenant filtering with existing data

- Access tenant list from parent component or API
- Implement tenant-specific report filtering
- Update report API calls to handle tenant filtering
- Ensure proper data flow between filters and summary
